## ðŸš€ About The Project

[cite_start]Every student and professional has felt the anxiety before a job interview[cite: 4]. [cite_start]While you can google common questions, you never truly get to practice in a realistic environment[cite: 5]. [cite_start]This project was born from a simple idea: What if you had a personal coach that knew your resume, understood the job you were applying for, and gave you real-time feedback? [cite: 8]

AI Interview Coach is a web application designed to be that coach. It leverages the power of Google's Gemini to provide a hyper-personalized, on-demand interview practice experience. Our platform helps you build confidence and polish your answers, making sure you're ready for the real thing.

### The Problem It Solves

We identified several critical gaps in the current interview preparation landscape:
* [cite_start]*Lack of Personalization:* Most prep tools are generic and don't tailor advice to your specific background[cite: 13].
* [cite_start]*No Delivery Feedback:* You rarely get feedback on how you speak, including your tone and clarity[cite: 14].
* [cite_start]*Prohibitively Expensive:* Professional mock interviews can cost between â‚¹8k-20k per session, making them inaccessible for many[cite: 15].
* [cite_start]*Not Available On-Demand:* You can't practice whenever you need to, especially for last-minute interviews[cite: 16].

[cite_start]Our platform addresses these challenges by providing a solution that combines realism, personalization, and advanced Generative AI[cite: 17].

## âœ¨ Features

* [cite_start]*Resume Intelligence:* Upload or paste your resume, and our tool will parse it to extract key skills and identify potential gaps to address[cite: 71].
* [cite_start]*Role-Aware AI:* Powered by Gemini, the coach generates custom interview questions based on the specific job role you select and the contents of your resume[cite: 72].
* *Voice Feedback Engine:* Answer questions naturally using your voice. [cite_start]The AI provides instant, actionable tips on your content, tone, and delivery to help you improve[cite: 73, 74].
* [cite_start]*Post-Interview Analysis:* Receive a comprehensive summary and analysis after your practice session is complete[cite: 84].
